# [ADR-001]: Use Next.js for Frontend

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We needed to choose a frontend framework for the MailSense application that provides:
- Server-side rendering (SSR) for better SEO and initial load performance
- API routes for backend functionality
- TypeScript support
- Strong community and ecosystem
- Good developer experience

## Decision

We will use Next.js as our frontend framework because it provides:
- Built-in SSR and SSG support
- API routes for backend functionality
- Excellent TypeScript support
- File-based routing
- Built-in image optimization
- Great developer experience with fast refresh
- Strong community and Vercel support

## Consequences

### Positive
- Faster time to market with built-in features
- Better SEO with server-side rendering
- Improved performance with automatic code splitting
- Simplified deployment with Vercel
- Large ecosystem of plugins and examples

### Negative
- Additional bundle size compared to a minimal setup
- Learning curve for team members not familiar with Next.js
- Potential over-engineering for simple features

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Create React App (CRA)
- **Pros**: Simple setup, well-documented, large community
- **Cons**: Lacks built-in SSR, routing, and API routes

### Option 2: Gatsby
- **Pros**: Excellent for static sites, great plugin ecosystem
- **Cons**: Overkill for our dynamic application needs

### Option 3: Custom Webpack + React setup
- **Pros**: Complete control over configuration
- **Cons**: Significant maintenance overhead, slower development velocity
